# Sign Stealing ML Model
Inspired by Mark Rober's ["Stealing Baseball Signs with a Phone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlRbfSavbI&ab_channel=MarkRober), in this project we develop a machine learning model to decode sequences of baseball signs, where each sequence independently indicates whether or not a baserunner is going to steal.
